# TODO

   - [ ] The client prevents changes to predictions, but the server doesn't
   - [ ] sort out mutation of person for login (postgraphql issue)
   - [ ] sort out mutation of picks on submit -- not there, reloading to /dashboard workaround
   - [ ] refetching for each mutation of prediction, yuck
   - [ ] create mutation to update all predictions in one go, fixes refetch issue too
